The user is asking a simple conversational question - "How are you?" - not a technical or coding request. I should respond naturally and conversationally. There's no need to use any tools or make any edits. I should just answer in a friendly, professional way.

Doing well, thanks for asking. How can I help you today—coding, project setup, or anything else you’re working on?
